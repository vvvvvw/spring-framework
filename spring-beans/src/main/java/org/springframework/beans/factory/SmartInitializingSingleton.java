/**
 * Callback interface triggered at the end of the singleton pre-instantiation phase
 * during {@link BeanFactory} bootstrap. This interface can be implemented by
 * singleton beans in order to perform some initialization after the regular
 * singleton instantiation algorithm, avoiding side effects with accidental early
 * initialization (e.g. from {@link ListableBeanFactory#getBeansOfType} calls).
 * In that sense, it is an alternative to {@link InitializingBean} which gets
 * triggered right at the end of a bean's local construction phase.
 *
 * <p>This callback variant is somewhat similar to
 * {@link org.springframework.context.event.ContextRefreshedEvent} but doesn't
 * require an implementation of {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener},
 * with no need to filter context references across a context hierarchy etc.
 * It also implies a more minimal dependency on just the {@code beans} package
 * and is being honored by standalone {@link ListableBeanFactory} implementations,
 * not just in an {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext} environment.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you intend to start/manage asynchronous tasks, preferably
 * implement {@link org.springframework.context.Lifecycle} instead which offers
 * a richer model for runtime management and allows for phased startup/shutdown.

//SmartInitializingSingleton是一个回调接口，调用时机是在spring容器启动过程中预实例化所有非懒加载的singleton Bean(在applicationcontext的refresh方法的倒数第二步preinstantiateSingletons())之后，会筛选出来
//所有已经实例化好的singleton Bean且该bean要 实现SmartInitializingSingleton接口，那么此时就会调用SmartInitializingSingleton的afterSingletonsInstantiated方法
//定义这个接口的目的是为了在常规的初始化操作之后执行一些特定的初始化操作从而避免提前初始化造成的副作用（比如调用ListableBeanFactory#getBeansOfType会导致提前初始化）
